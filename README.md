--------Summary

- 4 hosts have all TCP ports closed (silent or firewalled).
- 2 hosts run **dnsmasq on port 53**; one uses an outdated version (2.51).
- 1 host exposes **port 7070** with an unclear service (possibly streaming or admin panel).

--------Recommendations

- **Upgrade dnsmasq (2.51)** to a secure version.
- **Restrict DNS and 7070 access** to internal, trusted IPs.
- Monitor and investigate **7070/tcp** service for risk or misuse.
